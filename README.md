# Code generation

This project uses SharpTools :
https://github.com/jkoritzinsky/SharpTools

Since I want to avoid user to install lot of different tools to run the generator, generated code is stored in the repository.

If you want to change the mappings, you need to install visual studio SDK and run : Generator.bat manually
